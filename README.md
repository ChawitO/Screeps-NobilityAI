# Screeps-NobilityAI
Script for Screeps game

Codes I wrote for Screeps as a personal project. Learning JavaScript as I go, as well as practice using 3rd party API and reading documentations.

The idea is that, once completed, the AI will manage everything from room maintainance to exploration and expansion.
Input from user includes putting down coloured flags to mark certain areas for actions.
